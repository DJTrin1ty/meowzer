# Meowzer


Simple visually appealing mini game utilizing JavaScript and HTML5.


Listens for user input on keydown/keyup to move animated image accordingly.


Birds generated to spawn at random locations to ensure predictable gaming
is avoided.

Game keeps track of current high-score, most recent game's high score,
and phases (speed birds have).
